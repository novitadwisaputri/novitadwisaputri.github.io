# Summary

As a social media manager, I've worked for a company based in China for three years. Even though I work remotely, I've gotten really good at communicating with people from different backgrounds and time zones.

I spent a year studying the Chinese language and culture at Hainan College of Foreign Studies (Êµ∑ÂçóÂ§ñÂõΩËØ≠ËÅå‰∏öÂ≠¶Èô¢). It helped me understand the language better and learn more about Chinese culture. I even took part in a Chinese language competition organized by the Hainan Provincial Department of Education and came in third place!

I always try to go above and beyond and solve problems wisely. I'm really excited about the opportunity to help your company succeed and show you what I can do.
